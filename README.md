Goload is a simple CLI tool to spin up a load balancer given a Dockerfile

Usually creating a load balancer takes a lot of configuration with tools such as nginx or HAPROXY. This simple CLI tool lets you spin up a simple load balancer with minimum config. The goal of this will be to allow users to start up a simple round robin load balancer very quick, but also be able to configure the load balancer to fit their needs.
